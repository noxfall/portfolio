            <p>
                Hi! My name is Milos. I'm 29 years young, and I live in Novi Sad, Serbia.
                Programming has been my passion ever since I got my first PC, at 8yo. As I grew
                older, I diverged from computer science, decided to study chemistry. But some part
                of me could never part ways with CS and programming, knowing its potential. So I'm here
                to start over, and I plan to stick with it til the end this time...
            </p>
            <p>
                My current skillset includes the MERN stack, but I'm devoting myself to python environment as well.
                I'm also experienced with UNIX-like system administration, as I have worked as a junior system administrator
                before. Be that as it may, I feel quite confident that my experience can solve any demanding task out there.
                I have worked on real industry projects, using latest, cutting-edge technologies and practices.
            </p>
